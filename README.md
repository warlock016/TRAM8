# TRAM8 Module Firmware Hacking

LPZW.modules TRAM8 Repository for Firmware Hacking

Convert the compiled hex file to SysEx with the Script in "HEX_2_SYX Formating". 
```
python .\hex_2_syx.py "Tram8.hex"
```
You'll need intelhex extension for python (.\.> pip3 intelhex)

# Stock Firmware 
8 Gates of the same MIDI Channel + Velocity of those notes or 8 fixed CCs of same channel

V1.3 was necessary for the slight change on the learn button in HW1.5 - there is bodge fix (adding a pull down) not in the schematics


# Clocks & Random:

Gate Outputs:
	1: Run signal - goes high with start low with stop
	2: clock 24ppqn
	3: clock 4ppqn aka 16th triggers.
	4: 8th note trigger
	5: clock 1ppqn aka quarter note triggers
	6: half note shifted by a quarter (simple snare position)
	7: beginning of bar pulse
	8: 16th divided by 3 clock

Velocity/CV Outputs:
	1: random triggered each 16th
	2: random triggered each 16th
	3: brownian random triggered each 16th (drunken walk)
	4: random triggered each quarter
	5: random triggered each quarter
	6: brownian random triggered each quarter (drunken walk)
	7: random triggered each bar
	8: 16th stepped ramp to go from 0-5V in a bar
